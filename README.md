# SQL-Library

Database System Design for a Library

The main purpose of this project is to showcase the utilization of SQL and relational database management to design and implement the database system for a fictional library. This project includes multiple interlinked tables that simulate the behaviour of a real library that stores the information about books themselves, the different branches of the library, employee information, customer information and the borrowed/return status of books. The interlinked tables include primary and foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity and enable cascading updates. I populated these tables with sample data and crafted advanced queries, including inner joins, aggregation, and filtering, to extract actionable insights such as available books, genre-based listings, and employee counts per branch.
